# AED Map – Turkey (WIP)

This is a **work–in–progress** web app for visualising public Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) on a map in Turkey.

## What is an AED?

An AED is a portable device used to help people experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. It can analyse heart rhythm and deliver an electric shock if needed. In many countries, AEDs are required or strongly recommended in public places such as shopping malls, airports, stadiums and large workplaces so that bystanders can act quickly before an ambulance arrives.

## Project goal

The goal of this app is:

- to show nearby AED devices on an interactive map,
- to let the user see the **closest AED to their current location**, and
- to display practical details such as address, opening hours and access notes.

The project is currently focused on **locations in Turkey** and is still under active development.

> **Important:** The data in `aeds.json` is **fake / demo data** used only for prototyping.  
> It does **not** represent real AED locations and must **not** be used in emergencies.
